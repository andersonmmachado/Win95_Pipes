# Unity Windows95 Screensaver Project
## Overview
This Unity project aims to recreate the iconic Windows95 screensaver where pipes gradually fill a limited three-dimensional space without crossing each other. The pipes will be represented by cylinders and spheres, with each pipe having a random new color. When a pipe reaches a dead end, it should continue with a new pipe elsewhere.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andersonmmachado/Win95_Pipes.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity Hub using Unity 2022.3.11f1.
