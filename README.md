# Unity Windows95 Screensaver Project
## Overview
This Unity project aims to recreate the iconic Windows95 screensaver where pipes gradually fill a limited three-dimensional space without crossing each other. The pipes will be represented by spheres, with each pipe having a random new color. When a pipe reaches a dead end, it should continue with a new pipe elsewhere.

   git clone https://github.com/andersonmmachado/Win95_Pipes.git
